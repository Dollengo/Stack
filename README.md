## Static Stack

- The **StaticStack** class represents the static stack data structure. It has methods to initialize the stack, push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and display the **elements** of the stack.
- The **__init__** method initializes the stack with a **specified size** and creates an empty stack using a list.
- The push method adds an **element** to the top of the stack if the stack is not full. If the stack is full, it prints a message indicating that no more elements can be inserted.
- The pop method removes and returns the top element from the stack if the stack is not empty. If the **stack** is empty, it prints a message indicating that there are no elements to pop.
- The **display_elements** method displays all the elements of the stack from top to bottom.
- In the main section, the user is **prompted** to enter the size of the stack. Then, a StaticStack object is created with the specified size.
- A menu is **presented** to the user with options to push, pop, display elements, or exit the **program**.
- **Depending** on the user's choice, the corresponding method of the **StaticStack** object is called to perform the desired operation on the stack.
